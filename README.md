# Benefit claimants face landlord discrimination despite ruling

![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/A250/production/_106025514_gettyimages-457202678-1.jpg)

In August 2020, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53821317) thousands of landlords were trying to avoid renting their properties to benefit claimants, despite a judge ruling a blanket ban was unlawful.

About 75% of more than 9,000 listings on the website OpenRent said the landlords would not accept people on benefits.

It came after the ruling a single mother-of-two had experienced indirect discrimination when a letting agent refused to rent to her. That case established "persuasive authority" in law rather than a legal precedent, so it may have helped guide other courts in reaching future decisions, but was not binding.

OpenRent said it advised landlords to assess tenants "on their own merits".
